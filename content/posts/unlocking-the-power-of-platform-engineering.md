## Understanding Platform Engineering

Platform engineering is a game-changer in the technology landscape. It involves creating curated self-service layers that empower users to navigate complex systems with ease. These platforms provide a set of tools, services, and processes tailored to specific user needs, eliminating the struggles associated with disjointed systems and inefficient processes. With platform engineering, organisations can focus on value creation instead of managing underlying infrastructure.

## The Benefits of Platform Engineering

Implementing platform engineering practices offers a wide range of benefits for organisations. Firstly, it enhances the user experience by providing a curated set of tools and services that align with their requirements. This results in improved efficiency, reduced friction, and a seamless workflow. Secondly, platform engineering drives organisational agility, enabling faster time-to-market, scalability, and the ability to adapt to changing business needs. Additionally, it reduces operating costs by optimizing processes, automating repetitive tasks, and minimizing resource wastage.

## Real-World Success Stories

Several notable organisations have embraced platform engineering and reaped the rewards. For instance, companies like Nike and Adidas have built internal platforms that enable their teams to collaborate effectively, streamline processes, and accelerate innovation. Even Norway's police force has adopted platform engineering to improve their operational efficiency and enhance service delivery. These success stories highlight the transformative impact of platform engineering across various industries.

## Implementing Platform Engineering

To leverage the benefits of platform engineering, organisations should consider the following recommendations:

1. Establish dedicated platform teams: These teams will be responsible for curating and building internal platforms using reusable, configurable components and services.

2. Treat the platform as a product: Engage with end users to understand their needs and prioritize the technical capabilities, tools, and processes that will bring them the most value.

3. Foster collaboration: Encourage a culture of product management and facilitate ongoing collaboration between engineers and end users. This creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement and innovation.

4. Address skill gaps: Invest in upskilling existing staff through communities of practice and consider hiring individuals with platform-building expertise to strengthen the platform engineering capabilities within the organisation.

## The Future of Platform Engineering

As we look ahead, platform engineering is poised to become the standard practice for software engineering organisations. Predictions indicate that, by 2026, the majority of these organisations will have internal platform teams delivering reusable services, components, and tools. The future holds great potential, with the continued evolution of platform-building tools and a growing platform engineering community driving adoption and success in this field.

## Conclusion

Platform engineering offers organisations an opportunity to revolutionize their operations and deliver exceptional user experiences. By embracing this discipline, organisations can enhance agility, drive innovation, and improve overall business value. We encourage you to explore the potential of platform engineering within your organisation and embark on a journey toward unlocking its transformative power.
