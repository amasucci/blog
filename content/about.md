Hi and welcome to my blog ! ! !

My name is Antonio, nice to meet you, I am Italian and I love technologies. 
Thanks to my father, at the age of four, I started playing with hardware, software and electronics and I am not bored yet.

I did my BSc and MSc on software engineering and immediately after the graduation I moved to London with my wife (*girlfriend at the time*). I married her a while later, we had a little baby girl, and after few months we took a break from London and we went to live in Italy for one year, in 2017 we moved back to London.

[amasucci.com](http://amasucci.com/) is my personal blog, here you will find posts on _software engineering_ and _software engineering people_.

My interests are things like *design patterns*, *antipatterns*, *continuous delivery*, *devops*, *team culture*, *team building* and *leadership*.

Hope you enjoy it.
