Hi my name is *Antonio Masucci* and [amasucci.com](http://amasucci.com/) is my personal blog, you will find my personal opinion on things such as software engineering, design patterns, antipatterns, continuous delivery, devops and more.

As I said it will be my personal opinion, about particular things, in a specific time of my life, and since I generally change my mind about things I will try to keep update my post accordingly.

I also hope to get some help from you, so if you find something wrong (totally or partially), you just want to improve something or you simply disagree, feel free to comment with your opinions.
