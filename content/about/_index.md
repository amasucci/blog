Hi, I'm **Antonio Masucci** (anto), nice to meet you and welcome to my blog. 
[amasucci.com](https://amasucci.com/) is my personal blog, here you will find posts on _software engineering_, _people_, _psychology_, _self improvement_ and probably a good amount of random stuff.

Everything started when I was four and my father walked in with our first PC (an Olivetti M24), since then I started playing with hardware, software and electronics and I am not bored yet.

I was so fascinated by computers that I did my BEng and MEng on software engineering and immediately after the graduation I moved to the UK with my wife (*girlfriend at the time*), to find my dream job (I am still looking for it...). 

My interests are things like *cloud*, *design patterns*, *antipatterns*, *continuous delivery*, *devops*, *team culture*, *team building* and *leadership*.

Hope you enjoy it and thanks for reading!

*Anto*,
_father, husband, italian londoner, software engineer, Â¿blogger? ..._
